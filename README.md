# Another one of Zero's Furiously Creative Adventures

## What is this Exactly?
Welcome to another one of those things where Zero does something just to keep his mind off of not doing something amazing.

## Presenting
I present to you a radio streaming service even your mother would never watch if you have the right tracks hooked up. I didn't make the service; I just made the egg to run the server and maybe the image itself so I can cry myself to sleep.

## What Does It Do?
Exactly what it says it can doâ€”it plays a consistent radio stream for you, your friends, or even your uncle, for crying out loud. You can shove your music in there, and it just works.

## How Do I Use It?
TBH, I'm not entirely sure.

## Can I Advertise on It?
Hell yeah, make money on it. I'm not a huge financial nerd.

## Can NASA Hear It?
Become a popular first nerd and on the double.
