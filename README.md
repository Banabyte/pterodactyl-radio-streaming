# What is this exactly?
Welcome to another one of those things where zero does something just to keep his mind off of totally not doing something amazing.

# Presenting
I present you with a radio streaming service even your mother would never watch if you have the right tracks hooked up. I didn't make the service I just made the egg to run the server and maybe the image itself so I can cry to sleep.

# What does it do
Exactly what it says it can do, it plays a consistent radio stream to you, or your friends, or even your uncle for crying out loud. you can shove your music in the thing and it just works.

# How do I use it?
TBH

# Can I advertise on it?
Hell yea, make money on it. I'm not a huge financial nerd.

# Can NASA hear it
Become a popular first nerd. and on the double.
